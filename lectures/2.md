# Lecture 2: Design Principles

- [Iteration 0](/iterations/0) is over.
- Trade-offs: You know how to put pieces together, but you don’t know if they’re any good.
- Last lecture we had two different ways to implement subtasks:
  ![Last Lecture’s High-Level UML Diagram](/lectures/1/high-level-uml-diagram-from-lecture.png)
- What principles do _you_ follow when you’re drawing UML & writing code?
  - Not syntactical things, like arrows not crossing on a diagram, or indented code. We take those for granted.
  - Smaller classes.
  - Fewer classes.
  - Short code.
  - Code in which each line is simple to understand (80-column limit).
  - Code that runs fast.
  - **Why?** **Why not?**
- Some of these principles apply to both software design and code, as well as to other forms of design, like product design, graphic design, and so forth.
- Principles are at odds with one another.
  - To _decide_ is to _cut_: “late Middle English (in the sense ‘bring to a settlement’): from French décider, from Latin decidere ‘determine’, from de- ‘off’ + caedere ‘cut’.”
  - Principles aren’t _laws_. But you must have a good story for _why_ you’re breaking them.
  - Different communities tend to value different things. For example, Java values stability, while Ruby on Rails values progress.
  - For every principle ask **Why?** & **Why not?**
- For me, the most important is being easy to understand.
  - I’m mainly writing for people to read, not for machines to execute.
  - It’s relative: Who’s the audience?
  - Avoid fancy language features, avoid premature abstractions, avoid third-party dependencies, and so forth.

# [You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) & [Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

- How to make TODOOSE simpler?
- Roboose: Use GitHub as much as possible (notifications, database (both as JSON files and in issues), and so forth).
- **Why?** **Why not?**
  - Simple is only a starting point. [Sometimes simple isn’t easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/).
    - Assembly is simple (few features), but difficult.

# [Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

- When implementing subtasks in TODOOSE, have a `parent` field in both the `Item` and `Subitem` classes.

- Router in TODOOSE is
  ![Last Lecture’s Low-Level UML Diagram](/lectures/1/package-class-diagram-from-intellij--annotated.png)
  ```java
  .routes(() -> {
    path("items", () -> {
        get(itemsController::getAll);
        post(itemsController::create);
        path(":identifier", () -> {
            delete(itemsController::delete);
            put(itemsController::update);
        });
    });
  })
  ```
  but could be
  ```java
  .get("/items", itemsController::getAll)
  .post("/items", itemsController::create)
  .delete("/items/:identifier", itemsController::delete)
  .put("/items/:identifier", itemsController::update)
  ```
- **Why?** **Why not?**

# [Convention Over Configuration](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration)

- Port number in `Server`.
  - Both when Heroku provides one and when we don’t, when running locally.
- **Why?** **Why not?**

# [Loose Coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)

- Least knowledge.
- Depend on interfaces, not on implementations.
- `ArrayList` → `List` → `var`.
- **Why?** **Why not?**

# [Encapsulate What Varies](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/steverowe/2007/12/26/encapsulate-what-varies/)

- Things that change together should be near in the code.
- Controllers: Actions change more often than routes.
- **Why?** **Why not?**

# [SOLID](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/back-to-basics-solid)

- [Watch this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2yFMzxqwU), and [go watch Sandi Metz on this year’s Association for Computing Machinery Lecture Series in Memory of Nathan Krasnopoler](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/news-events/association-for-computing-machinery-lecture-in-memory-of-nathan-krasnopoler/).
- We’ll only talk about the **S** (_Single Responsibility Principle_) in lecture, the rest is covered in [Assignment 2](/assignments/2).
- `ItemsRepository` vs. static methods on `Item`.
- **Why?** **Why not?**

# The Zen of Python

Available by running `>>> import this` on the Python console.

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
- **Why?** **Why not?**
