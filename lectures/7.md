# Lecture 7: Implementation · Investigating Mysteries

1. The goal isn’t necessarily to solve the mysteries, but to investigate them methodically.
2. Think out loud. Share your thoughts. Ask questions. When investigating alone, use a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
3. Reproduce the problem on your machine.
4. Establish what you expected to occur, and what really occurred.
5. Find a [minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example). Break the problem in smaller pieces and get rid of the nonessential parts.
6. Try variations on the problem: different data, different browsers, different tools, different machines, and so forth.
7. Challenge your assumptions. If you think you know something, come up with an experiment to prove it.

# The Mystery of the Magic Island

I was born in an island in Brazil called Florianópolis. Some people call it the [Magic Island](http://placestovisitbrazil.com/florianopolis-magic-island/). Indeed, there seems to be something magic about it. Check the following snippet in the JavaScript Console in Google Chrome:

```javascript
const islandsInBrazil = [
  "Fernando de Noronha",
  "Ilha do Mel",
  "Florianópolis",
  "Ilha Grande"
];
const islandChoice = prompt("Choose an island in Brazil", "Florianópolis");
if (islandsInBrazil.includes(islandChoice)) {
  alert("You’re right. This is an island in Brazil.");
} else {
  alert("You’re wrong. This is not an island in Brazil.");
}
```

[Here’s a video for you to learn more about Unicode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4&t=344s).

Different tools interpret strings in different ways:

**Chrome:** Shows both strings as equal, even when editing and moving the cursor.

**Safari:** Normalizes the string as you paste it. The example doesn’t work if you paste it into Safari’s developer tools.

**IntelliJ:** Let you put your cursor _in the middle of_ the character with a combining accent!

**Visual Studio Code:** Takes two presses of the right arrow to move the cursor over the character with a combining accent.

Some tools to work with strings in JavaScript:

**Break a string apart into characters:** [`Array.from()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).

**See the Unicode code point of a character:** [`codePointAt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/codePointAt).

Bringing `Array.from()` and `codePointAt()` together, we have:

```javascript
> Array.from("Florianópolis").map(s => s.codePointAt(0))
[70, 108, 111, 114, 105, 97, 110, 111, 769, 112, 111, 108, 105, 115]
> Array.from("Florianópolis").map(s => s.codePointAt(0))
[70, 108, 111, 114, 105, 97, 110, 243, 112, 111, 108, 105, 115]
```

**Normalization:** [`normalize()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize).

# The Mystery That Doesn’t Add Up

This Sunday I’ll turn 29 years old. Right now I’d say I’m 28.8 years old, and after this lecture I’ll be a bit older, say 0.1 years older. I think that’ll make me 28.9 years old, but I’m not sure because I’m terrible at arithmetic. I wrote a JavaScript program to check my answer, but it doesn’t seem to work every time. Could this be because I was born on the Magic Island?

```javascript
alert("Welcome to Leandro’s age calculation checker");
const leandrosCurrentAge = Number(prompt("Leandro’s current age", "28.8"));
const ageIncrementAfterLecture = Number(
  prompt("Age increment after lecture", "0.1")
);
const expectedAgeAfterLecture = Number(
  prompt("Expected age after lecture", "28.9")
);
const ageAfterLecture = leandrosCurrentAge + ageIncrementAfterLecture;
if (ageAfterLecture === expectedAgeAfterLecture) {
  alert("You got the math right!");
} else {
  alert("You got the math wrong!");
}
```

Floating points may be imprecise, but they’re _way_ faster. That’s why we use them.

See <https://0.30000000000000004.com> for more on this topic.

When writing automated tests, you almost never want to assert that two floating point numbers are [equal](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertEquals-float-float-); you almost always want to assert that they are equal within a given [range (what the JUnit documentation calls a `delta`)](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertEquals-float-float-float-).

If you don’t want the imprecision of floating points and don’t care about your program being slower, you can use arbitrary precision arithmetic, for example, the `BigDecimal`s in Java and libraries such as [`decimal.js`](http://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/) in JavaScript.

Watch [this short talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) on other quirks of JavaScript, including things like:

```javascript
"Leandro " + 1;
"Leandro " - 1;
5 / 0;
0 / 0;
0 ** 0;
[] + [];
[] + {};
({} + []);
({} + {});

const islandsInBrazil = [
  "Fernando de Noronha",
  "Ilha do Mel",
  "Florianópolis",
  "Ilha Grande"
];
islandsInBrazil[1000];

const pieRankings = {
  apple: 9,
  pumpkin: 7,
  raspberry: 10
};
pieRankings.banana;
pieRankings["banana"];

try {
  undefinedVariable;
} catch {}

try {
  pieRankings();
} catch {}
```

# The Mystery of That Which Wasn’t Itself

While I was investigating the problem above, I changed the line that says `ageAfterLecture === expectedAgeAfterLecture` to `ageAfterLecture === ageAfterLecture`. Surely `ageAfterLecture` should be equal to itself, but somehow I still got an alert saying “You got the math wrong!”. If only I could remember which values I had input…

```javascript
alert("Welcome to Leandro’s age calculation checker");
const leandrosCurrentAge = Number(prompt("Leandro’s current age", "28.8"));
const ageIncrementAfterLecture = Number(
  prompt("Age increment after lecture", "0.1")
);
const expectedAgeAfterLecture = Number(
  prompt("Expected age after lecture", "28.9")
);
const ageAfterLecture = leandrosCurrentAge + ageIncrementAfterLecture;
if (ageAfterLecture === ageAfterLecture) {
  alert("You got the math right!");
} else {
  alert("You got the math wrong!");
}
```

Some ways to produce not-a-number (`NaN`) in JavaScript:

```javascript
Number("Not a Number");
0 / 0; // (A nonzero number divided by zero produces ‘Infinity’)
Infinity / Infinity;
NaN + 1; // And other operations with a NaN
"Hi" - 1; // And other operations that don’t make sense, like ‘[] / {}’
```

# The Mystery of That Which Was Itself

<small>
For your convenience, I put the [code from this mystery](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/commit/d753b15561ccc4c9ec31f0458f3ec4e0d5ea0582) in the [`the-mystery-of-that-which-was-itself`](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/tree/the-mystery-of-that-which-was-itself) branch in [TODOOSE](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose).
</small>

I was playing with the creation of TODO items in TODOOSE. I wanted to check that it really increased the number of TODO items, so I included some debugging `console.log()`s in the `PlusButton` component. Most times it worked as I expected, but sometimes when I clicked on the plus button I got a result that surprised me.

```javascript
class PlusButton extends React.Component {
  async handleClick() {
    console.log(`Before: ${await this.countItems()}`);
    fetch("/items", { method: "POST" });
    console.log(`After: ${await this.countItems()}`);
  }

  async countItems() {
    return (await (await fetch("/items")).json()).length;
  }

  // ...
}
```
