# Assignment 4: Implementation

In [Lecture 4](/lectures/4) we started to implement a new feature in [TODOOSE](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/): the ability to see items that were marked as completed, as opposed to just removing them from the list forever.

For this assignment you must complete the implementation.

Go through the [Issue](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/issues/24), its corresponding [Pull Request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/pull/25), and the [project board](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/projects/3) (look at Iteration 4). Go through the code base on the [`show-completed` branch](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/tree/show-completed), which contains `TODO` comments you must fill in.

A complete checklist of all the things left for you to do will show up here after the lecture, as we’ll be making some decisions live.

We’ll also publish a video on the recommended workflow and submission process tomorrow, Thursday, 2019-09-26.

# Submission

<label>
**GitHub Identifier**  
<input type="text" name="github" required pattern="[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-]*[A-Za-z0-9]">  
</label>
<small>
For example, [`jhu-oose-example-student`](https://github.com/jhu-oose-example-student).  
Don’t include an `@` sign at the beginning—this isn’t a [mention](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams).  
GitHub identifiers **do not** start with `2019-student-`.

<label>
**Commit Identifier**  
<input type="text" name="commit" required pattern="[0-9a-f]{40}">  
</label>

For example, [`48092726db45fd4bcde21e3712ac2d8e4a094797`](https://github.com/jhu-oose/www.jhu-oose.com/commit/48092726db45fd4bcde21e3712ac2d8e4a094797).  
Graders will look at the code base as of this commit.  
You may find the commit identifier on the commits page at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>/commits/master`. Usually you want the most recent commit.
