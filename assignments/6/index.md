# Assignment 6: Implementation · React

Starting from the code we wrote together in [lecture](/lectures/6).

First, finish the implementation by addressing the [TODOs left over from lecture](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/b33f16f6a004e8e6cbc5c75877583022e0b81d00/index.js#L1-L3), then add the following features.

# A “Play Again” Button

The button must work by resetting the state of the React components, not by reload the page.

# Lizard 🦎 and Spock 🖖

Extend the game following the rules from [this The Big Bang Theory episode](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock).

# Add an Explanation of Why Someone Won

With Lizard and Spock the game got too complicated, so a simple “Player 2 wins!” isn’t enough anymore. When the game is over, add an explanation, for example, “Lizard poisons Spock, so Player 2 wins!”
